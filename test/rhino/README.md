This directory contains the JAR file for Mozilla Rhino.
The JAR file is used exclusively for testing and is not distributed as part of
buble-config-rhino. Thus, I did not place Rhino's license at the top-level
directory, but under this subdirectory (see [`./LICENSE`](./LICENSE)).

The current JAR file has been downloaded from the following page:

- https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/releases/tag/Rhino1_7_13_Release
